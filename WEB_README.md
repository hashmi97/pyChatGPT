# Yet Another chatGPT tool!
This is a wrapper that uses chatGPT to generate a text fitting your request. In its basic form, it asks you for a role 
that the system can assume. Followed by any additional information it might need to generate a response, and finally it 
generates the required response. 

You'll find there are two pages on this website, the difference between the two is the preloaded example.
You can use either and expect the same result. 

## How to use the tool?
### Role
This is the role that the system will assume. You should be as descriptive as possible. For example
`Doctor writing a prescription` or `middle school teacher`.

### Example
This is a field that can be toggled by clicking the checkbox. If toggled, you can provide the system with a template to 
try and use for inspiration while preparing the final response.
You will find an example of how it works in the legal domain demo . 

### Additional Parameters
This is a field that can be toggled by clicking the checkbox. If toggled, you can provide the system with any additional
data that you would like to include in the final document such as names and dates. 
You will find an example in the legal domain demo as well. 


### Submit!
Once you have added all the required information, just press submit and wait while the system is generating a response
